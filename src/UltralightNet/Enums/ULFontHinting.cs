	/// <summary>Lighter hinting algorithm-- glyphs are slightly fuzzier but better resemble their original shape. This is achieved by snapping glyphs to the pixel grid only vertically which better preserves inter-glyph spacing.</summary>
	Smooth,

	Normal,

	/// <summary>Strongest hinting algorithm-- outputs only black/white glyphs. The result is usually unpleasant if the underlying TTF does not contain hints for this type of rendering.</summary>
	Monochrome,
